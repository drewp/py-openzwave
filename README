This is the readme file for the py-openzwave project.

---------------
Building on Ubuntu 10.10 - (drewp@bigasterisk.com)

The 'cython' version for Ubuntu 10.10 is 0.12.1, which is too
old. You'll get an error at 'cdef extern from # "<string>"'. Removing
that cython and running 'easy_install cython' will get you a version
at least as new as 0.14.1, which will work.

First build the openzwave library:
(cd openzwave/cpp/build/linux; make)

Then the python library:
python setup.py build

Then try running python (or ipython) and pasting the contents of
test.py. You need to leave python running after the statements are
done so callbacks can come in. 

For the tricklestar USB device, a more robust device name to use is 
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Prolific_Technology_Inc._USB-Serial_Controller_D-if00-port0 
(as opposed to ttyUSB0/ttyUSB1/etc).

I (drewp) still don't know the workflow for adding new devices. For
that I used https://code.google.com/p/openzwave-control-panel/ which
does have an 'add device' operation.

----------------------------
Adding devices

from the ozcp code, 

          setAdminFunction("Add Device");
          setAdminState(
                   Manager::Get()->BeginControllerCommand(homeId,
                                   Driver::ControllerCommand_AddDevice,
                                   web_controller_update, this, true));
then it waits for
  case Driver::ControllerState_Completed:
